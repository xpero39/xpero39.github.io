I grew up on a small farm in the countryside of a small European country of Slovenia. My parents were not explicitly farmers but rather company workers, father worked in a factory and my mother worked a simple office job. But they both grew up on farms and my father continued to work on the farm alongside the factory job to provide extra income and food for the family. This meant that as soon as I was able, I helped with various tasks on the farm. At first this was just small tasks assisting my father but later I started also driving a tractor, helping with the harvest, feeding the animals, etc.

Everything on a farm follows seasons, in spring you plant the seeds and later in summer you harvest the crops. In autumn you prepare the fields for the winter and in winter you work in the forest to prepare wood for the next winter.

<!-- working hard -> same input, same output -->


<!--  need for innovation for growing outputs and better returns -->


<!-- farm, sport team or business -> all need inovation or they stagnate -->
